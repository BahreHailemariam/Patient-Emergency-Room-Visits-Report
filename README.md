## Project Overview
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard that delivers in-depth insights into emergency room (ER) operations—designed to help healthcare administrators monitor performance, drive improvements, and optimize patient care.
## Objectives
- Illuminate trends in patient visits, including volume by time periods and demographics
- Measure operational efficiency through metrics like average wait times and satisfaction scores
- Identify peak hours/days, departmental referrals, and demographic patterns for better staffing and resource planning
- Enable deep exploration with dynamic slicers and performance indicators
## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop – For data modeling, visualization, and report creation
- Power Query – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures and advanced insights
- (Optional) Excel or CSV – Raw data input
## Dataset Overview
Columns might include:
- *Date* – Date and time of the ER visit
- *Patient_ID*, *Age*, *Gender*, *Race* – Demographics
- *Wait_Time* – Minutes before initial treatment
- *Satisfaction_Score* – Scale rating (e.g., 1–10)
- *Department_Referral*, *Admin_Flag* – Referral and admission details
## Key Features & Visualizations
- **Monthly Trends** – Patient volumes, average wait times, and satisfaction by month
- **Time Patterns Heatmap** – Hourly and weekday heatmaps for visits and wait time trends
- **Demographic Breakdowns** – Age, gender, and race group insights
- **Referral and Admission Analysis** – Proportions of referred vs. walk-in patients and admission rates
- **Slicers and Filters** – Filter data by date range, demographic segments, or referral types
- **KPI Cards** – Highlight key metrics like overall satisfaction, wait time, and patient count
## Sample Insights (Inspired by Real Projects)
- Peak visit times: Busy hours around 11 AM, 7 PM, and late-night, with Mondays and Tuesdays being particularly active 
- Average wait time: Roughly 35 minutes, with satisfaction scores hovering around 5 out of 10 
- Referral trends: Most visits are non-referred, with common departments being General Practice and Orthopedics 
- Demographics: Highest visit frequency among ages 30–39, with diverse racial distribution and balanced gender split
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Load **hospital_er_data.csv** into Power BI.
3. Use Power Query for data cleanup and transformations.
4. Define DAX measures (e.g., **AvgWaitTime**, **SatisfactionScore**, **ReferralRate**).
5. Build visualizations and configure interactive slicers.
6. Save your **.pbix** and optionally publish to Power BI Service.
## Future Enhancements
- Add **predictive analytics** to forecast peak visit times
- Integrate more data dimensions—e.g., reason for visit, follow-up outcomes
- Connect with **hospital staffing systems** for real-time adaptive resource management
